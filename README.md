## General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)
This project investigates the influence of ancient philosophical texts on shaping modern linguistic theories, with a focus on discussions from philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. By analyzing these early works alongside contemporary linguistic frameworks, the study explores the continuity between historical and modern approaches to semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. Using texts sourced from Project Gutenberg, the research examines how exposure to ancient linguistic thought enhances comprehension of core linguistic principles in an educational context. The findings aim to highlight the enduring relevance of classical philosophy in understanding modern linguistic theories.
  
## Background information (list at least two studies that have looked at your topic, including correct referencing)
Plato’s Cratylus on Language Philosophy
Plato's dialogue Cratylus delves into the nature of names and their relationship to objects, laying foundational ideas about semantics that resonate in modern linguistic debates. His exploration of whether words have a natural or conventional connection to their meanings remains influential in the study of linguistic signs.
(Reference: Plato, 360 BCE. Cratylus. Translated by Benjamin Jowett, available via Project Gutenberg.)

Aristotle’s Contributions in On Interpretation
Aristotle's work On Interpretation (Peri Hermeneias) discusses propositions and their structure, addressing syntax and meaning. His logical approach to language influenced both medieval and modern linguistic frameworks.
(Reference: Aristotle, 350 BCE. On Interpretation. Translated by E. M. Edghill, available via Project Gutenberg.)

Modern Influence: Chomsky's Linguistic Theory
Noam Chomsky’s generative grammar highlights the influence of logical structures akin to those discussed by Aristotle. While Chomsky does not directly cite ancient texts, his emphasis on universality in grammar reflects the continuity of philosophical inquiry into language.

## Research question and hypotheses 
Research Question:
How have ancient philosophical discussions on language, particularly from texts by Plato and Aristotle, influenced the development and comprehension of modern linguistic theories?

Hypothesis:
Students exposed to ancient philosophical discussions on language through curated texts from Project Gutenberg will demonstrate a deeper understanding of linguistic principles compared to those focused solely on modern frameworks.

## Method
Dataset:
The primary corpus will consist of freely available texts from Project Gutenberg, including:

    Cratylus by Plato (translated by Benjamin Jowett)
    On Interpretation by Aristotle (translated by E. M. Edghill)
    Selected works of modern linguistics theory for comparative purposes

Sampling Method:
Participants will be undergraduate linguistics students divided into two groups. The experimental group will study a curriculum integrating ancient philosophical texts, while the control group will focus solely on modern linguistic theories.

Study Design:

    Pre- and post-study assessments will measure participants' conceptual clarity and academic performance on linguistic principles.
    Surveys and focus groups will provide qualitative insights into students’ perceptions of the material.

Analysis:
Statistical methods will compare assessment scores between groups to determine the impact of exposure to ancient philosophical texts. Thematic analysis of qualitative data will identify recurring patterns in participants' experiences.
