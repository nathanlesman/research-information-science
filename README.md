## General information, describing your project (i.e., the abstract)
This project investigates the influence of ancient philosophical texts on shaping modern linguistic theories, with a focus on discussions from philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. By analyzing these early works alongside contemporary linguistic frameworks, the study explores the continuity between historical and modern approaches to semantics, syntax, and pragmatics. Using texts sourced from Project Gutenberg, the research examines how exposure to ancient linguistic thought enhances comprehension of core linguistic principles in an educational context. The findings aim to highlight the enduring relevance of classical philosophy in understanding modern linguistic theories.
  
## Background information (list at least two studies that have looked at your topic, including correct referencing)
Plato’s Cratylus on Language Philosophy
Plato's dialogue Cratylus delves into the nature of names and their relationship to objects, laying foundational ideas about semantics that resonate in modern linguistic debates. His exploration of whether words have a natural or conventional connection to their meanings remains influential in the study of linguistic signs.

Aristotle’s Contributions in On Interpretation
Aristotle's work On Interpretation (Peri Hermeneias) discusses propositions and their structure, addressing syntax and meaning. His logical approach to language influenced both medieval and modern linguistic frameworks.

Modern Influence: Chomsky's Linguistic Theory
Noam Chomsky’s generative grammar highlights the influence of logical structures akin to those discussed by Aristotle. While Chomsky does not directly cite ancient texts, his emphasis on universality in grammar reflects the continuity of philosophical inquiry into language.

## Research question and hypotheses 
Research Question:
What thematic and structural similarities exist between ancient philosophical texts on language and modern linguistic theories?

Hypothesis:
Key concepts in modern linguistic theories (e.g., universality, syntax, semantics) reflect themes found in ancient philosophical discussions on language, suggesting a foundational continuity.

## Method
Method:

    Dataset:
    Texts sourced from Project Gutenberg, such as Cratylus by Plato and On Interpretation by Aristotle, alongside publicly available modern linguistic texts (e.g., Chomsky’s Aspects of the Theory of Syntax).
    Study Design:
        Perform a comparative text analysis using computational linguistics tools.
        Use topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to identify recurring themes across the ancient and modern texts.
        Conduct sentiment and semantic analysis to compare the treatment of key linguistic concepts like meaning and grammar.
    Analysis:
    Visualize overlaps and distinctions using cluster plots and thematic heatmaps. Interpret findings to trace conceptual evolution.
Analysis:
Statistical methods will compare assessment scores between groups to determine the impact of exposure to ancient philosophical texts. Thematic analysis of qualitative data will identify recurring patterns in participants' experiences.
